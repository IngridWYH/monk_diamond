<p>It was a huge green diamond!<br/>She quickly realized it was Monk diamond, the most famous diamond in the world! She was so suprised that she was spinning in her head. She was afraid that if a police passed by, she will say that it was Mary who stole the diamond because yesterday, she and her mom was staying up late watching TV. They saw the news report was about the lost diamond, even the newspaper was also about the diamond.</p>
<p>                               CHAPTER TWO</p>

The police staition had send a message to Mary! She wondered why the police staition had send her a message so she opened the message to take a look(Mary is a very curious little child). What she saw made her jump with surprise. The polices had exaim the diamond and proved it was FAKE!</br></br>
<p>                               CHAPTER THREE</p>
Mary fainted. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself at the police staition. She found her whole family surrounding her. She asked her mom:"What...what is happening to me?" Mom said:"You fainted. But then I and your brother, your sister and your dad found you. We were afraid of that you might be sick or something"</p>
<p>Mary was very relived that her family had found her. But she had some important things to do. She had to find out WHO had stole the diamond and WHY did she/he do this. She told the whole story to her family, and they were shocked. But luckly they all said:"Of course we will help! It's a pleasure!"\^o^/ Yay! @v@ thought Mary.

<p>                               CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p>Today(Friday, 30 November 2018), Mary and her family"s adventure had begin. First, they went to the museum to look for clues. They didn't find lots of clues, only a few papers. The first paper said: "Go to the cave." Mary said:"Huh? I don't think I understand. There are loads of caves in the mountain. There are Butterfly cave, Diamond cave, Monkey cave....." Suddenly, Mary's sister jumped up:"I think I know! We are hunting for a diamond, not a butterfly, nor a monkey. So... That means we need to go to the Diamond cave!" Mary's dad said:"How are you sure?" Mary's sister said:"Well, I'm not sure. But I think we can still go there to check."</p>
<p>                               CHAPTER FIVE</p>
<p>When they reached the cave, they saw a sign in front of the cave:"PIRATE ANDROID'S CAVE" Mary's family turned to look at each other. They nodded together, and winked at each other the same time(In Mary's home, it means they are all thinking the same thing). They were all thinking that pirate Android was the one who stole the diamond. Then Mary whispered:"I don't feel right here. We should keep hiding, in case of that Android might be back in any moment." They all agreed, so they turned to hide in the bushes. Mary's brother asked:"Does anyone bought a phone or binoculars?" Mary's mom said: "You are a genius, Matthew(that's Mary's brother's name)! Mary, you can take the binoculars and watch if Android had come. If he comes, don't shout. Just make a "Ok" sign. Then Kitty(Mary's sister) can use my phone and call the police. But beware: If Android heared you or saw you, we could be in big trouble." "For the binoculars, use mine." Mary's sister pulled out a pair of brand new yellow binoculars and handed them out to Mary.</p>
<p>                                  CHAPTER SIX</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard footsteps coming closer and closer. Mary made a "Ok" sign, and her sister started dialing "999". She also called detectives, to find out where did Android put the diamond.</p> 
<p>The polices arrived quickly, the detectives, too. The polices and detective make way: and a professor stepped out. He was wearing teensy weensy glasses on his tip of his nose. Mary's mom suddenly realized it was her friend in the university! "Professor sparkle von volt!" Cried Mary's mom. "Lea(Mary’s mother)! It had been years since we see each other!"Cried the professor.They all miss each other very much!</p>
